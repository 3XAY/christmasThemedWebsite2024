# christmasThemedWebsite2024
My submission for the Winter Boba Drop by Hack Club.
This was actually super useful, because although I have a website and I know a small amount of HTML/CSS, I didn't know enough to make a whole website.
I've always relied on tools like MkDocs to do the bulk of the work so I could focus on the content and basic styling, but this was a super helpful project.
